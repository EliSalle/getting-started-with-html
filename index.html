    <b><em>Notes on HTML Programming From Lesson #1</em></b> <br><br><br><em>Elements and Tags</em><br><br>Tags are opening or closing entities alone. Elements are entire phrases including opening tag, content, and closing tag.<br><br><em>Types of Elements</em><br><br>There are block elements and inline elements. Block elements make a "box" around the content and are recognizable because there is always one tag at the beginning of the content and one at the end. Inline elements, though, do not have a content; they are therefore called void elements. <br><br><em>Why Computers are Stupid</em><br><br>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very difficult to use since a minor spelling mistake by a programmer can cause enormous problems in a program.
